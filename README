Food Diary
==========

Food Diary is a Firefox extension which allows you to track your calorie
consumption on a daily basis, thus helping you to manage your diet.

The data is stored in an sqlite database in the installation folder of the
extension.

How to Build
============

SCons (http://www.scons.org/) is used to build the xpi file. Python must be
installed to run Scons.

Type 'scons' on the command line in the source directory. This will build
'fooddiary.xpi' in a directory called 'bin' at the same level as the source
directory.

Type 'scons -c' to clean any previous build.
